## 💎 Core Functionalities

Helio provides a comprehensive suite of features for seamless collaboration:

### 1. 🚀 Immediate & Anonymous Collaboration
*   **Instant Room Generation**: Users can generate a unique room ID directly from the landing page.
*   **Zero-Friction Access**: Collaborators can join via URL or Room ID instantly as anonymous guests.

### 2. 🔐 User Dashboard & History
*   **Secure Authentication**: Users can sign up/login to access a personalized dashboard.
*   **Room Persistence**: All rooms created by logged-in users are **automatically saved to MongoDB**.
*   **History Access**: Users can revisit any previous coding session; the state is preserved exactly as left.

### 3. 💬 Communication Suite
*   **Real-time Chat**: In-room chat for discussing logic without context switching.
*   **Social Graph**:
    *   **Friend Requests**: Connect with other developers.
    *   **Private Chat**: Direct messaging system for out-of-band communication.

### 4. 🎨 Interactive Whiteboard
*   **Infinite Canvas**: A shared vector-based canvas for architecture diagrams.
*   **Real-time Sync**: Strokes are synchronized instantly using a custom broadcast protocol.
*   **Shape Correction**: Utilizes `perfect-freehand` algorithm for beautifying strokes.

### 5. 💻 Professional Editor
*   **Multi-language Support**: C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and 10+ others.
*   **Live Presence**: Remote cursors and selection highlights for all active users.
*   **Cloud Compilation**: Execute code remotely via JDoodle API integration.

## 🚀 Engineering Highlights

Detailed implementation of **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Design Patterns** to solve complex real-time synchronization challenges.

*   **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**:
    *   Implemented `Yjs` to manage distributed state across clients, ensuring strong eventual consistency without a central authority for conflict resolution.
    *   Solves the "concurrent edit" problem (Split-Brain) using vector clocks and deletion tombstones.
*   **Fault-Tolerant Architecture**:
    *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Custom implementation (`utils/CircuitBreaker.js`) to prevent cascading failures during third-party API outages (e.g., Code Compilation Service).
    *   **Resilient Socket Handling**: Robust logic to handle "Offline-Online" transitions, ensuring no code edits are lost during momentary network drops.
*   **Real-time Event-Driven Communication**:
    *   Built on `Socket.io` (WebSocket) for low-latency, bidirectional events (`JOIN`, `SYNC_CODE`, `ELEMENT-UPDATE`).

*   **Atomic Design System**:
    *   Component-driven UI architecture (`Atomic Design`) using Design Tokens (`tokens.css`) and reusable atoms (`Button`, `Input`, `GlassPane`).

## 🏗 System Architecture

### Monolithic Client-Server Architecture
Helio is built as a robust monolith to minimize complexity while maximizing data integrity.

```

### Collaborative Sync Protocol
1.  **Local Mutation**: User types a character; `Yjs` creates a differential update.
2.  **Propagation**: The update is emitted via `socket.io` to the server.
3.  **Broadcast**: Server relays the update to all other clients in the `roomId`.
4.  **Convergence**: Choosing CRDTs ensures that all clients eventually reach the exact same state, regardless of the order of arrival of packets.
5.  **Persistence**: The state is effectively serialized and stored in MongoDB for future retrieval.

## 🧩 Algorithms & Data Structures Used

*   **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**:
    *   Uses a **Doubly Linked List** of item structs ($ID_client$, $Clock_{local}$) to manage insertions/deletions.
    *   Guarantees convergence (Commutativity) for concurrent operations.
*   **Circuit Breaker State Machine**:
    *   States: `CLOSED` $\to$ `OPEN` $\to$ `HALF-OPEN`.
    *   Prevents system resource exhaustion during external API failures.
*   **Deboucing**:
    *   Applied to network-heavy operations (like saving to DB) to optimize throughput.
